# Experimental interest mention vector search.

The goal of this site is a fuzzy vector based search for when MPs are disclosing their interests in debates.

This site contains two main features.

- [A daily updated list of possible mentions](/regmem_vector_search/analysis/rfmi_possible_mentions.html) in the last month.
- A [static list of mentions](/regmem_vector_search/vol/) from 2023-09 to 2024-09 of possible mentions by MP for WhoFundsThem volunteers. 

Both of these have a low threshold set - and include many false positives.

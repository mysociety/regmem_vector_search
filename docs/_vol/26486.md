>In a previous life, as a pupil barrister, I sat behind prosecuting counsel at the trial of the murderer of Jo Cox MP. I learnt an awful lot—not about legal process or criminal procedure, but from Jo’s family, who arrived each day at court with smiles, holding hands and with a bag of sweets that they offered to assembled journalists, security guards and indeed the lawyers, including the defence barrister. I take inspiration from their strength. It was an honour to campaign for my hon. Friend the Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) in that vital by-election, and it is even more so to share these green Benches with her today.

>Thank you, Ms Nokes. It is such a great privilege to speak in this debate and make my maiden speech after the hon. Members for Woking (Mr Forster) and for Chelmsford (Marie Goldman). My hon. Friend the Member for Southend East and Rochford (Mr Alaba) made a fantastic speech about the city in his constituency, which I have had the great privilege of swimming in. His speech did due justice to that great place. My hon. Friend the Member for Swindon North (Will Stone) made a faintly terrifying speech about his Brazilian jujitsu skills, and he certainly did justice to Swindon, too.

>I know the Government have been working hard to protect and support businesses as much as possible through these times, recognising the need to fulfil our responsibility to get the economy back on track. I therefore welcome a number of the announcements in the Budget—in particular, the decision to increase the VAT registration threshold to £90,000 from 1 April 2024. As the Chancellor said in his speech, I have been pressing for that as it will support businesses with the administrative and financial impact of VAT charges. It will ensure they can earn more before paying VAT and spend more time working. Hairdressing and hospitality sector businesses in Loughborough raised that point with me, and I in turn brought it to the attention of the Chancellor and Business Ministers. The increase in the threshold will mean that those businesses can earn more money before any VAT is due. That will not only mean that hard-working business owners will get the opportunity to earn more before tax but that self-employed trades will be able to complete more work before attracting VAT charges to their contracts.

>the legal experts have highlighted that the proposed new clause seeks only to determine the respective responsibilities of the police and the CPS in the processing involved in preparing and submitting a case file to the CPS for a charging decision. It would not remove any substantive protection or the obligation to review and redact the personal data in case file material. It simply provides for such review and redaction by the police after—rather than before—a charging decision has been made. The law enforcement directive, on which the relevant part of the 2018 Act was based, would have permitted that when the Act was passed, and I am told there is no legal reason why it cannot be introduced now.

>Exactly the same happens in my borough council in respect of supported housing benefit. Because some charities in my constituency are not **register**ed social landlords, the council cannot claim the whole of the benefit back from the Department for Work and Pensions, and is therefore out of pocket by about £1.5 million, which is simply unsustainable on a budget of about £16 million a year. Instead of the customers of Departments such as the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities—the councils—paying for those things, the Department that wants them to be done should pay.

I will say, however, that if we are talking about a fairer funding formula, the operative word is “fairer”, and that standard is not being met at present.

>The hon. Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell) alluded to this, in the context of education, health and care plans. Last Friday evening two of the eight slots in my constituency surgery were about EHCPs, and on the previous Friday three of them were. The county council has a statutory responsibility to deliver EHCPs, but the Department of Health and Social Care can say what it wants about the “H” element without having to deliver the resources. The county council feels that it has to deliver them itself, and that puts additional cost and time pressures on the 20-week window within which it must finalise an EHCP. I should like something to be done about that, so that the Department that asks for something actually pays for it.

>It is crucial that we do everything possible to ease the administrative burden on police officers, to free up thousands of policing hours and get police back on to the frontline, supporting communities and tackling crime. My new clause would go a long way to achieving that, by facilitating the free flow of personal data between the police and the CPS, which would speed up the criminal justice process and reduce the burden on the taxpayer—a stated aim of the Government. How disheartening it must be for a police officer to take time and patience redacting data only to find that the case does not go forward, as occurs in 25% of cases. Common sense must prevail.

>My new clause lays out a blueprint for that reform and would insert a proposed new section into the 2018 Act to exempt the police service and the CPS from complying with the first data protection principle—except in so far as that principle requires processing to be fair—or with the third data protection principle when preparing a case file for submission to the CPS for a charging decision, thereby facilitating the free flow of personal data between the police and the CPS. If the CPS decided to charge, the case file would be returned to the police to carry out the redaction exercise before there was any risk of the file being disclosed to any person or body other than the CPS. In the 25% of cases in which the CPS decides not to charge, the unredacted file would simply be deleted by the CPS.

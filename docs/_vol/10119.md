>Many **interest**ing points have been made, but one of the most **interest**ing things I have heard is the number of Opposition Members who have been complaining about the level of the tax burden. I will assume that when they  produce their general election manifestos, each will say that they will reduce the burden of tax on the people of this country. I will bet you a bottle of something nice, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the Labour party manifesto comes out, we will see a higher fiscal burden on the people of this country than there would be under a Conservative Government.

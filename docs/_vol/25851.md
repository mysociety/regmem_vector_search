>I thank my hon. Friend for his question. The most important thing we can do is bear down on inflation, because that will bear down on **interest** rates, which affect us all. I would also point to the cost of living support that the Department for Education is providing for students. I would be happy to discuss the matter with him further.

>The Opposition have to choose. Do they stick to their plan to borrow an extra Â£28 billion a year, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies says risks sending inflation, **interest** rates and mortgage rates up, or do they choose our plan to bring inflation down, taxes down and debt down? They cannot have it both ways. If the shadow Treasury team has no answer today, it will fall to the Leader of the Opposition to grasp the issue. Rather than anonymous briefings to the BBC over the weekend, he will have to make a choice. That is the difference between being the party of opposition and being the party of government: credibility with the public over credibility with their activists.

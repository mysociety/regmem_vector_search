>In all honesty, I probably ought to **declare** an **interest**, but pensioners living in Edinburgh and Glasgow do not face the same sorts of increases as pensioners  living in a remote and faraway constituency such as mine when it comes to living costs such as running a car, buying groceries and heating the house. Will the Government look at ways of targeting these particularly hard-hit people?

>It is of great **interest**, is it not, that there is not one Member from the governing party in Scotland present for this debate?

>The right hon. Member is making a most **interest**ing speech. Does he agree that the present size of the British Army is militating against recruitment? A great many people who might be good in the Army and have considered it as a career option are saying, “Actually, if I could get another job I might do better,” and that is very, very dangerous.

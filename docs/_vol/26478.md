>I pay tribute to my predecessor, Craig Tracey, who was hard-working and served our constituency well. He did important work for breast cancer awareness and  raised questions in Parliament on issues that matter to our constituents. He was supportive of local events. I am sure that constituents and Members of this House will join me in thanking Craig for his work and wishing him and his family all the best for the future.

>In my 30s, I retrained as a solicitor and went into property law, because it is property that shapes our lives and our communities, from the building of new leisure facilities to the provision of affordable homes. There is nothing like the feeling of working with someone through the ups and downs of buying their dream home. Sadly, though, through my career I have watched as fewer and fewer young people have become able to realise that dream. That is why I am proud to be part of this Government, who know that the security of affordable housing is something that nobody should ever be without. I pay tribute to those people I have worked with throughout my career and recently at Evans Derry solicitors, who have ensured that the people of Atherstone and Coleshill have access to high-quality legal services on their doorstep, and who were incredibly supportive of my becoming their next MP.

>It is a great honour to make this speech during the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill. The Bill is important to me and my constituents, who face many years of disruption and confusion because our trains and stations are operated by different companies. It will bring our trains back under the control of the public sector, generate investment in our stations, and make it easier for constituents like mine to book travel and tickets. Hopefully, it means that our rail services will be made truly accessible for disabled passengers, with support and help always guaranteed.

>Now, I can reflect on how much sport and drama have contributed to my life and the lives of those I have met through those activities. For me, sport and drama were drivers of social mobility, and they help to give confidence and aspiration to so many young people, breaking down barriers to opportunity. That is why I will work hard to ensure that young people gain access to activities and local facilities that have sadly been lost across the country.

>You say that our Chancellor and the Prime Minister are not here on the Government Benches, but where are your leader and your shadow Chancellor? They are not here either. You talk about means-testing being right: we have a difficult financial situation and difficult decisions that we have to take, so the right hon. Gentleman seems to agree with us on that.

>Coleshill is a market town named after the River Cole, with a long history as a coaching town. I have had the pleasure of meeting residents at the Coleshill warm room and have played tennis there for many years, and can say that it is a wonderful community that I am proud to represent. I will work closely with businesses across the constituency, such as HT Brigham and Co, Tow-Trust Towbars, Jaguar Land Rover, BMW, Bristan and LTS Global Solutions, to make sure the local community is benefiting from the innovation taking place in my constituency. LTS Global recently let me take a trip in one of the first electric heavy goods vehicles on the road in the west midlands. These companies show that green energy solutions are possible and bring investment into our communities. The world-class golf resort of the Belfry is also in my constituency, where just a few days ago we enjoyed the British Masters golf, hosted by Sir Nick Faldo. I learned about its Eagles programme, an innovative programme training young golfers.

The people of my constituency are down to earth, straightforward, direct, honest, hard-working people. Those are the values that I was raised with, and those are the values that will continue to guide me in my role. I am so very proud to be representing North Warwickshire and Bedworth and all its towns and villages—my home—and I have not underestimated the challenges ahead. I promise I will work hard and do my very best for all my constituents, and stay true to my values, for as long as I have the honour of representing them in this place.

>I welcome the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton North (Mrs Blundell), who gave a wonderful speech. It was **interest**ing to hear about her constituency; I confess that I did not know much about it before, but I certainly know a lot about it now. It was generous of the hon. Lady to pay rightful compliments to her predecessor, Chris Clarkson, who is much missed on this side of the House.

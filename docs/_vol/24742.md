>On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The law around marriage is part of my portfolio as a shadow Justice Minister, but I would like to seek your advice this afternoon—don’t worry, it is not marital advice that I require. Given my portfolio, would it be in order for me to invite you and perhaps Members from across the House to congratulate a very special couple, who will mark their 70th wedding anniversary tomorrow? They are particularly special, as they are my own mum and dad, Jean and John Cunningham, who were married all those years ago. I am extremely proud of them for reaching this remarkable milestone, and I am pleased that I have been able to share this news with the House.

>In a similar vein, new clause 38 seeks to update the statute book to ensure that the law keeps pace with change, this time in relation to liability for corporate offences. The new clause also stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham North, and he pays tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Dame Margaret Hodge) for her continued campaigning on this matter. It would introduce individual liability so that senior executives can be held liable for criminal activities committed by a company or partnership on the basis of negligence. The offence would apply both to crimes committed by the company or partnership and to a failure to prevent those crimes from happening.

That said, we are keen to understand exactly how the provisions in the new clause would work, the impact they would have and the number of potential cases likely to be created. We are not sure that the new clause is fit for purpose, so we will also be **interest**ed to hear from the Minister. However, we are satisfied that this is an area in which we would wish to legislate after the general election, if we are successful.

>I want to alert the Leader of the House to action by a private security firm on the Wynyard estate in my constituency to stop legitimate political campaigning. There are thousands of homes on the estate, but Chris McDonald, who I hope will succeed me as the Labour MP for Stockton North, was ordered to leave the area by guards. He was told that they did not allow cold callers, and that was how they categorised Labour activists. The Leader of the House will recognise that as anti-democratic, denying thousands of people the right to hear from those who seek to represent them. I would be obliged if she could use her offices to investigate the silencing of politicians, and make it clear that people of whatever political colour should not be stopped carrying out perfectly legal activities.

>New clause 16 was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Gerald Jones), who is in his place today and can speak to the tragic case in his constituency that it seeks to address. I want to reiterate what we said in Committee. The Road Traffic Act 1988 provides vital protections to all of us. It bars certain behaviours that we know are dangerous,  but there is a loophole whereby those sorts of behaviours can be exhibited on private property without sanction. It is reasonable to bring the laws on private property into alignment with the RTA 1988 in the **interest**s of public safety.

>I note that in the Minister’s response to the Committee, she suggested that the new clause as drafted would also prevent individuals who lawfully sell sex from doing so online, where they feel safe, and as a result these individuals could be forced into additional danger by having to advertise on the street or underground in some way. I certainly recognise the Minister’s concerns. Any provision must ensure that those whom it is intended to protect do not inadvertently come to additional harm. I am, however, sceptical that the measures in the Online Safety Act 2023, whereby online platforms for individual advertising are responsible and accountable for the content on their sites, will do as much as she claims to address these issues.

My advice to the Chancellor is to get the forensic accountants to pore through the books and reports, and they will find tens of millions of pounds that could have been reinvested in the people of Teesside, instead of being pocketed by two private sector businessmen, after the Teesworks Tory Mayor gifted them 90% of the asset.

>Several years ago, we were promised tens of thousands of jobs at the Teesworks site. Few have so far materialised and, because of secrecy and Tory politicians and others hiding behind company law, we cannot find out what is guaranteed to happen and what is a stream of hopeful promises. That is why I would like the Government to come up with a plan to extend the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to all boards, companies and organisations that spend public money. Maybe that would help us to find out how the bulk of the major  assets at the Teesworks site and Teesside airport ended up in the hands of two private companies, and where the tens of millions spent subsidising the airport actually went.

It need not cost them a penny—they can make the polluter pay by placing a levy on the tobacco companies, who know they can afford it.

>Clause 28 of the original Bill provides for the Secretary of State to appoint a controller to keep under review and report on the running of any rented prison spaces abroad. It also extends the power of His Majesty’s chief inspector of prisons to inspect and report on the conditions in such places. The Bill, however, places a great deal of unaccountable authority in the hands of the Executive, who can make provision for any arrangement by means of secondary legislation. It is silent on how those subject to this arrangement will be treated. Similarly, it provides no guarantee that the prison rules in secondary legislation, which govern crucial issues including segregation, complaints and the use of force, would apply. I hope the Government share my view that any agreement made between the UK and a foreign state should be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and oversight. Amendment 59 would help to enable that to happen by requiring the controller to report any breaches of the arrangement to the Secretary of State.

>In conclusion, I wish to pose a few questions to the Minister. What impact will the provisions in the Bill have on the criminal justice system and, in particular, our crisis-hit Prison Service? As I said at the outset, many of the Government’s own new clauses and amendments did not arrive until a few days before today’s Report stage. What impact assessment has been carried out and when can we expect to see it? May I remind the Government that we are still waiting on the economic impact assessment for the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, which received Royal Assent two years ago?

>On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. During Prime Minister’s questions today, I asked the Prime Minister why 34% of children in my constituency live in poverty. Before the Prime Minister answered, the Home Secretary chose to add his pennyworth. I have contacted his office, advising him of my plan to name him, but sadly he has chosen not to be in the Chamber. He was seen and heard to say, “Because it’s a shithole.” I know he is denying being the culprit, but the audio is clear and has been checked and checked and checked again. There is no doubt that these comments shame the Home Secretary, this rotten Government and the Tory party. He is clearly unfit for his high office. Madam Deputy Speaker, will you advise me how I can secure an apology from the Home Secretary at the Dispatch Box for his appalling insult and foul language?

>The Minister is a decent man. The Government make much of getting value for money, but they have little to say about the handing over of Teesside’s greatest land asset to two private developers, who have since banked tens of millions of pounds in profits, leaving crumbs for the public. That is after the investment of £500 million of taxpayers’ money and no private investment. Is the Minister content with that, or does he believe, as his own Government’s inquiry into the Tees Mayor’s business dealings recommended, that the deal should be renegotiated?

>I sat on the last Childcare Bill Committee seven years ago, and I warned then that the plans would not fly because of lack of investment. We have just heard an example of that from the hon. Member for Buckingham (Greg Smith). The Minister all those years ago said that the market would create itself. It did not, and costs remain high while the number of places available is restricted. The spring Budget was an opportunity to get that right, and I welcomed the announcement of a   funding package as well as the extension of the subsidised 30 hours entitlement—it was a step towards helping parents and providers with affordability and sustainability concerns—but this investment was too long overdue, and more will be needed to address the structural problems in the early childhood education and care system if the funding increases are to be implemented effectively.

>Amendment 61 would ensure that HMIP could inspect escort arrangements under which prisoners are transferred to foreign prisons. Clause 28 of the original Bill specifies that the chief inspector may inspect or arrange for the inspection of any prisons where prisoners are detained under an arrangement between the UK and a foreign state. The inspectorate’s powers to inspect escort arrangements were made by amendments to the Prisons Act in section 46 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. It is particularly important that the inspectorate should also be able to inspect the escort arrangements for the transfer of UK prisoners to foreign prisons. Our amendment would bring the legislation into line with the inspectorate’s powers in relation to prisons in England and Wales by also enabling it to inspect or arrange for the inspection of escort arrangements. A foreign state with which the UK makes an agreement could potentially be many thousands of miles from the UK. The transfer of prisoners could involve a lengthy journey including a variety of modes of transport such as, potentially, prison vans, planes, trains and ferries. The potential for trouble appears limitless.

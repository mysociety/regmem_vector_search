>New clause 18, the related amendment, is designed to prevent any detriment below a certain annual revenue level to governing bodies and organisations that have their events listed and broadcast outside subscription paywalls. I know from my extensive discussions with governing bodies that they are in something of a bind. On the one hand, they support their sport and want to see it in front of as many eyeballs as possible—and perhaps, on a cynical level, to have as many eyeballs as possible in front of perimeter advertising as well. On the other hand, they receive a decent whack of cash for the TV rights—funds that go into developing the sport and supporting the grassroots—and that might well take a severe knock if the value of the rights is cut through listing in group A.

>In lieu of any action to address this, new clause 18 would attempt to solve the funding gap by providing financial support to governing bodies, who could rely on that revenue stream to offset any loss of income caused by group A listing. That is a proportionate, cost-effective way of ensuring that there is no detriment from listing, while limiting access to the fund to those who actually need it, rather than those organisations that are already awash with cash. Of course, governing bodies in the devolved nations, being much smaller, are hugely hit by being part of a large UK broadcast market but a very small domestic market. To address the question that the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) asked in an intervention, I would suggest that if the Government are content to flush away nearly £10 billion on unused personal protective equipment, they are flush enough to cough up the relatively small sum needed to protect both grassroots sports and the principle of national teams on free-to-air TV.

>If the 1996 Act is entirely reserved to Westminster, so must be the financial implications of measures enacted under that amended Act. It is not up to the Scottish Government to fix the consequences of the UK Government’s broken devolution system, and it is entirely in order that the UK Government compensate governing bodies and others whose income falls below a threshold if it drops as a result of listing. Taken together, new clauses 16 and 18 would not only give group A listing a firm moral footing, but give rights holders a firm financial footing. Surely that is a win for everyone, including this Government.

We even managed to get the hon. Member for Moray (Douglas Ross) to vote with us on that occasion, but we have still seen no action from this Government to conclude that. That is one of the excellent points in our reasoned amendment. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is the SNP that will be working for the people of Scotland, not this Government?

>It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart), the Chair of the Transport Committee, on which I serve alongside him. He made many good points and I agree with much of what he said. We still have good questions about the Bill on technical details and insurance among other things, which we will undoubtedly cover in great detail in Committee. His final point about bringing the public with us is key. During the Select Committee’s inquiry, which was referenced by the Chair, I brought that up several times with the witnesses. As the Chair said, we accept things like the DLR, but that is fixed transport; this is very different. Obviously, as we have seen with smart motorways, the public may not buy it unless we and the industry are robust in what we are selling them.

In the end, the meeting came after Committee stage had concluded. That was disappointing, but it was a reflection of the wild agreement and consent on all sides for the vast majority of the Bill, resulting in an extremely swift conclusion to the Committee. The Scottish Government and their Ministers and officials have been engaged with the UK Government and their Ministers and officials on at least two occasions to discuss the implications for devolution of clause 50, and the proper remit of both Governments. In Committee, the Minister was forthcoming about discussing matters further with the Scottish Government, and I thank him for that. I believe those discussions have taken place.

It would be an utter nonsense to say that speakers of Gaelic have less of an **interest** in seeing sports on free-to-air TV than their Welsh-speaking counterparts, yet that is what the current legislation implies. BBC Alba has developed a reputation for high-quality sports coverage since its inception. It therefore has a strategic **interest** in where sporting rights go, simply because it has invested a great deal of time and money into securing some of those rights and broadcasting the sports free to air not just in Scotland, but across these isles.

We all know that revenue at the Treasury is already an issue, and will become an ever-increasing issue every year, so we have to have that debate sooner rather than later.

I say “for the most part” because, unfortunately, the Scottish Government’s representations on clause 50 have so far been ignored. Clause 50 is hugely problematic because it gives the UK Government the power to amend Acts of the Scottish Parliament in areas that are fully devolved, with no recourse to this place or to Holyrood. As it stands, there will be nothing to stop the Secretary of State laying a statutory instrument containing regulations that are counter to Acts passed at Holyrood, where the UK Government regulations would override the Scottish Parliament’s Act.

>Following on from the question of my hon. Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire (Kirsten Oswald), the Minister’s answers have taken sophistry to new levels. She said that 99.7% of voters were able to vote, but that is only of those who turned up to vote, and many will not have bothered to try and vote. The Government knew that young people, ethnic minorities and the unemployed would be disproportionately affected but they did it anyway. Incidentally, having tried to apply myself, I can attest to the fact that the Scottish young person’s concessionary travel card requires a lot more proof of ID than the London Oyster card for young people. Will she just admit that this Government’s version of voter ID is blatant antidemocratic gerry- mandering?

>The Minister has been forthcoming with me, including in Committee, about his commitment to constructive discussion with the devolved Administrations, and I welcome that again. However, with the greatest of respect for him, in around six months we are expecting a change of Government and he will likely no longer be there, and whatever pledges or commitments have been made cannot bind his successors. We need a commitment in legislation that it would take an Act in this place to amend or scrap.

>I fully understand that sports broadcasting rights inflation has been significant over the last decade and more. I understand that it is difficult for an STV to make a winning bid for Scotland rights commercially viable, due to the size of the TV market in Scotland. That is made harder still by the fact that UEFA has bundled Scottish international football rights with those of Wales and Northern Ireland to try and draw larger bids and more money for itself and the national associations. Although the same rights inflation has impacted the BBC, it does not have the same commercial considerations as an STV or an ITV. I appreciate, however, that Tory culture wars have inflicted severe damage to the funding levels available to the BBC in recent years. However, the BBC is required to serve all audiences across the whole of the UK, including provision for those in the nations and regions. From a sporting point of view, that simply does not happen.

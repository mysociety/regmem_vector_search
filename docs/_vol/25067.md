>The right hon. Gentleman, who has a long-standing **interest** in these matters, knows that we do not comment on whether an organisation is being considered for proscription. What is clear is that Iranâ€™s malign activities, including the activities of the IRGC, are completely unacceptable. I can give him an assurance that we keep these matters under very close review.

>To conclude, this important Bill has demanded strong and careful scrutiny through its journey in the other place and in this House. Our personal liberties and our national security depend on it. It is in the national **interest** to get it right and to ensure that legislation like this is both appropriate and proportionate in its scope. It must also be effective in maintaining the powers that our police and security services already have to disrupt and defeat criminals and malign actors who seek to harm us and undermine our way of life. I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to the points made by  Opposition Members and to the other right hon. and hon. Members speaking after me, all of whom will be working in the national **interest** and wanting to ensure that the Bill protects both our safety and our liberty.

>As the shadow Home Secretary said, the Opposition will work in the national **interest** with the Government on national security because, as legislators, we all have a duty to ensure that the law is one step ahead of those who seek to harm us. As lawmakers, we have a duty to ensure that when technical Bills are before us on matters relating to national security, we scrutinise them carefully and get into the detail. Members on both sides of the House have fulfilled that important duty with a number of thoughtful and considered contributions in this debate,  including the right hon. and learned Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Sir Jeremy Wright), who spoke, as always, with great authority and made important points about oversight and the **interest**s of economic wellbeing. I am certain that we will return to those in Committee.

>At present, while companies must try to identify persons with significant control, all they are really asked to do—as Lord Vaux explained—is look at the shareholder register. If there is no shareholder with 25% or more, they can reasonably conclude that there is no person of significant control, but if there is no obligation for the person who is acting as the nominee to disclose on whose behalf they own shares, PSC identity can remain hidden. It is far too easy for dishonest actors to hide their identities. The company concerned has the right to ask the nominees, but if the company is controlled by a dishonest actor, it is unlikely to do so. The amendment deals with that issue at its root, seeking full transparency over owners hiding behind nominees  for illicit purposes, but instead of strengthening legislation here, the Government are watering it down. They have tabled amendment (a) to Lords amendment 23, which would remove the requirement to declare if a person is holding shares as a nominee, thus essentially removing the primary principle of the original amendment. We need Lords amendment 23, and we will vote against amendment (a).

>Let me speak first to Government amendments which we support. I congratulate the Minister on the number of U-turns on areas that Labour argued for in Committee and on Report, including on closing loopholes around third party enablers and introducing a failure to prevent fraud offence. We welcome Government amendment 1, passed in the other place, which would expand the scope of objective 2 in clause 1, requiring Companies House to also take into account the accuracy of information already on the register before the Bill comes into effect. Government amendments 35 to 50, which all relate to the authorisation of corporate service providers, are vital amendments, especially amendment 35, which requires the registrar to publish the name of the authorised corporate service provider who has carried out ID verification. We welcome amendment 43, which requires the registrar to refuse the application for authorisation as a corporate service provider if it appears that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to become an ACSP.

>Let me deal first with Lords amendment 23, tabled by Lord Vaux. As he explained, one of the classic ways in which to hide the real ownership of a company is through the use of undisclosed nominees arrangements, when a shareholder is named on the register but is in fact holding the shares on behalf of another person. In simple terms, the amendment aims to close that loophole by making it a requirement for shareholders to state, as well as their name and address, whether they are or are not acting as a nominee. If they are acting as a nominee, they will have to provide the name and address of the person on whose behalf they are holding the shares. The Government’s argument against the amendment is that the existing “persons of significant control” declaration threshold and legislation would lead to those nominees effectively being declared.

>Lords amendment 115 creates an obligation for the register of overseas entities to be updated within 14 days of an entity’s becoming aware of any change, bringing it into line with the “persons of significant control” register. We have expressed concern previously about the fact that the register of overseas entities is one of the only registers that are required to be updated annually, rather than when a change occurs. This means that, at best, the register is providing only a snapshot of land ownership by overseas entities. We support the sentiment behind Lords amendment 115. Twelve months is certainly too long, and there is a significant risk that if the legislation goes through in its current form, overseas entities may be able to make changes within the 12-month period but change them back before their annual reporting requirement in order to evade transparency. There has been no solution to that loophole, but we need one. That solution, and a more appropriate threshold, need to be addressed, and with an evidence base. I do note the concerns expressed by the Law Society and others about the current amendment. We will not be voting on Lords amendment 115, but we believe that the Government must look again at instituting a period informed by data and analysis which will close this evident loophole.

>I hope the hon.

As she says, the children going into these secure schools may be there for a period of months, or they may be there for longer. Bearing in mind there has to be an assessment of their education on entry, what consideration is there for the continuity and quality of that education, as well as the maintenance of relationships with family? Children as young as 12 are being cared for in these secure schools—that is very young. How will visiting arrangements and temporary release arrangements be determined? It is important that risk assessments are followed so that families and communities continue to have confidence in the reforms as they are rolled out.

>Lords amendment 117 was tabled by Lord Agnew—who, I remind the House, resigned from his role in Government tackling fraud because of the Government’s “lamentable track record” in this area. We must be driven by the principle of maximum possible transparency. The amendment would require Companies House to publish information about trusts controlling offshore companies holding land in the UK, which is vital for transparency of land ownership. This amendment is much stronger than Government Lords amendment 124, which kicks the can down the road when it comes to acting on trusts by prompting yet another consultation. New research published by a group of academics from the London School of Economics and Warwick University on the register of overseas entities has found that the true owners of more than 100,000 properties in England and Wales controlled via overseas shell companies are not public, despite the rules that came into force on 31 January. Analysis of the register by Transparency International shows that trusts are used to hide the ownership of about 7,000 entities, which is about a quarter of those on the register. Trusts are also notorious for their use in sanctions evasion, a case in point being last year’s story of Alisher Usmanov’s allegedly using trusts to obscure the beneficiaries of his £170 million UK property portfolio.

>The Government have tabled amendment (a) to the new clause entitled “Failure to prevent fraud” in Lord Garnier’s amendment 151. As we have said, we welcome the steps taken by the Government on failure to prevent fraud,  but there are two problems with the current offence, about which the Minister has already heard during the debate: first, it applies only to large organisations as defined in the Companies Act 2006, and secondly, it does not cover money laundering. Government amendment 151, which introduced a failure to prevent fraud offence, was amended in the other place to remove the planned exemption for all organisations that do not qualify as “'large organisations”. If it is left as it is, the introduction of a “failure to prevent fraud” offence will apply to just 0.5% of all businesses in the UK. As Lord Gamier pointed out so aptly in the other place, with 99.5% of businesses being exempt, that would be the equivalent of only prosecuting murderers over the height of 6 feet 6 inches.

>In addition, since the most recent money laundering regulations were brought in, the UK has had only one corporate criminal conviction for money laundering, so it is pretty clear that the existing safeguards against money laundering are not enough. Here is a chance to take stronger action and to include in the new offence a failure to prevent money laundering, and the Government should take it. We will be supporting this amendment to stay part of the Bill.

>Although I congratulate the hon. Member on introducing today’s Bill, which clearly has cross-party support, it is puzzling that it is the responsibility of Back Benchers to bring in this important legislation. It can hardly be said that we have a crowded legislative agenda in the House. There should be enough Government time to necessitate this. These issues were also raised by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee in 2016, 2019 and  2021. Given that the Government have been so enthusiastic about taking advantage of Brexit bonuses when they relate to sacking striking nurses, scrapping consumer rights or undermining environmental protections, it beggars belief that it has taken so long for us to have proposals on much-needed and uncontroversial tweaks to the EU pet travel scheme.

I acknowledge the powerful contributions that have been made today, which include points about the illegal trade and, importantly, the awareness of where the mothers and fathers have come from and their welfare, as my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central (Sarah Jones) said. There were also important contributions from the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Dr Hudson) about diseases that come with illegal importation. We are all indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for City of Chester (Samantha Dixon) for  her discussion of ferrets, including her challenging  some of the myths and highlighting the character and companionship of ferrets.

>Government amendments 146 to 150 introduce further provisions limiting SLAPPs that feature economic crime. I particularly thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill for his advocacy on this issue throughout the passage of the Bill and in Committee. SLAPPs are a form of abusive proceedings. It is for us to send a signal and to change the law in the public interest. I would, however, ask the Minister for clarity on the Government’s intention to cap costs via secondary legislation, set out in one of the Bill’s factsheets. It would  be helpful if he could give us an idea of when the Government are considering doing that, and how quickly he expects it to happen.

This is a huge step forward, which also follows considerable pressure and work between the Government and both the Opposition and their own Back Benchers throughout the Bill’s passage. The amendments take us forward, but the evidence shows that we need to go further, which is why we will support Lord Garnier’s amendment 159.

>The Government have tabled a motion to disagree with Lords amendment 161 and have offered a counter-amendment (a), which would oblige the Secretary of State to report on potential policies to extend cost caps, but this is a serious issue to address now. I see no reasonable explanation as to why the Government would continue to oppose the inclusion of this amendment in the Bill and the strong backing it would give to the enforcement agencies, which we would expect to act with a strong threshold of evidence in order to bring any cases—a point that I hope will address any other concerns the Minister has.

>May I start by congratulating the hon Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Dr Johnson) on securing this Bill and on her speech? Like others, I have a long-standing **interest** in youth justice, having served on the Justice Committee, but also because I have a young offenders institution in my constituency, which I have visited on many occasions

>At present, while companies must try to identify persons with significant control, all they are really asked to do—as Lord Vaux explained—is look at the shareholder **register**. If there is no shareholder with 25% or more, they can reasonably conclude that there is no person of significant control, but if there is no obligation for the person who is acting as the nominee to disclose on whose behalf they own shares, PSC identity can remain hidden. It is far too easy for dishonest actors to hide their identities. The company concerned has the right to ask the nominees, but if the company is controlled by a dishonest actor, it is unlikely to do so. The amendment deals with that issue at its root, seeking full transparency over owners hiding behind nominees  for illicit purposes, but instead of strengthening legislation here, the Government are watering it down. They have tabled amendment (a) to Lords amendment 23, which would remove the requirement to **declare** if a person is holding shares as a nominee, thus essentially removing the primary principle of the original amendment. We need Lords amendment 23, and we will vote against amendment (a).

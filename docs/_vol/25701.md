>I will, because I was trying to intervene a few moments ago, as the hon. Gentleman will hopefully recall. My point was simply going to be that during the mid-2010s, there was a fantastic opportunity to invest in our infrastructure—repairing our schools and so on—when **interest** rates were at a record long-term low, and that opportunity was missed. Does the hon. Gentleman not regret that?

>The right hon. Gentleman is making some powerful points, and I have huge respect for him when it comes to this topic. Does he agree that we are in real danger of turning off the **interest** and the investment appetite among many other nations, such as Korea and Japan, which see the UK as having vast expertise in offshore wind development sites, and that legislation of this kind will undermine that market?

>On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. A year ago tomorrow, I raised with the Prime Minister a really  important point about the payment of a fine to the EU of £2.3 billion. Following that question to him, I wrote to the Prime Minister asking for an explanation. A year on, I have not had a reply. I would have thought it would be in the **interest**s of all in this House to understand how it was that a payment of £2.3 billion was paid as a fine for late payment to the EU. It is in our **interest**s to understand what happened, so is there any recourse I can take to understand what happened?

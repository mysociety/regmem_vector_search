I will, of course, vote with the Government this evening—I have always voted with the Government to date, and I hope that I never find myself doing anything other than that. The issue that I am concerned about is the presumption against sentences of a year or less. There is a pragmatic argument that I am ready to hear on this measure, which says that we must do this simply because we need the places. The argument that I cannot accept is that this can make the public safer.

>I really welcome this plan; I welcome the extra £200 million, the new patient bonus, the measures to get dentists into areas that do not have them and the minimum UDA. These are all good things that will help people in Harborough, Oadby and Wigston to get a dentist. Can I ask the Secretary of State to press on with two things? The first is the move to a proper national funding formula. Dentistry is the only part of the NHS without a funding formula, which disadvantages shire and coastal areas with older populations. The second is the next round of contract reform—the move to band 2b is working, and dentists are using it, but there are patients with complex cases for whom a capitation-like payment would be much better, as the British Dental Association pointed out. I encourage the Secretary of State to start working on that difficult group so that we can get extra help for them too.

Courtyards and shared spaces in the development were not adopted by the council. Astonishingly, each tiny courtyard was run as its own financial entity and was subsequently managed by a company called Chamonix, which turned out to be extraordinarily difficult to contact. Each year the residents were forced to pay “maintenance” charges for a couple of minutes’ work over a whole year. One of my constituents wrote to me:

>The Government amendments we are debating today are welcome. They strike a good balance between the interests of tenants and of landlords. For example, new clause 30, which makes the commencement of the end of no-fault evictions dependent on county courts being ready, is sensible. The slow recovery of the courts from the covid backlog has been frustrating, and there is a much wider question about how we can get rid of old-fashioned court practices that slow things down. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill), Chair of the Justice Committee, made important points about the paper-based nature still of a lot of what goes on there.

It is not easy to get the balance right, but in putting forward this suite of carefully judged amendments, the Government have done that.

>The Government have made a range of other sensible reforms in the new clauses before us to ensure that there is fairness for landlords as well as tenants, including new clause 15 which gives those who let out properties some confidence in the first six months. There are the new student grounds as well, and I note that even landlord groups such as the National Residential Landlords Association are now saying we should get on with this legislation, so I think this is about right.

>I have never been a landlord, but I have been a private renter and I greatly welcome some of the measures in the Bill as they would have helped me and other private renters a lot. I was offered some extraordinary properties when I was a private renter. I remember that one had dog mess all over the floor, while another in Elephant and Castle had bare wires hanging out of the wall and a gas cooker hanging off the wall. I welcome the extension of the decent homes standard to the private rented sector through this legislation, and it is striking how little controversy there has been about that given how big a deal it is. The proportion of private rented homes that have a major category 1 hazard in them has already come right down, from 24% when we came into office in 2010 to just 12% now, but that is still too high, and it is three times higher than in the social rented sector. So it is great that today we are pressing on with fixing this.

>Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I believe that today the SNP has been treated unfairly. But it is not just the SNP that has been treated unfairly. Those of us who would like to vote for the SNP motion must now, if we want to do so, vote against the Labour party’s amended motion—a motion that the hon. Member for Rhondda (Sir Chris Bryant) has just said would, if we voted for it, lead to an immediate general election, so we are being placed in an unfair position if we wish to support the SNP motion. We have now seen the exit of SNP Members and many Conservative Members from the Chamber. We are clearly in an intolerable situation. It is a sad situation, Madam Deputy Speaker.

>The final small thing that we must do in the Bill is to start the “turnaway”—I use that word advisedly—from ground rents. Ground rents are not payments made in return for any service; the historical rationale for their existence is totally obsolete. A 2018 survey found that half the people who faced these escalating bills did not realise that they would be applied when they bought their properties, and they cause huge problems with remortgaging. I understand the problems and challenges of having to move away gradually from this model, but we should start to turn the supertanker now. We are talking about pure economic rents and pure rentiers; it is a totally unfair system. We might have to move slowly, but we have to start the movement away from these ground rent grazers, because this is an unfair system with no rationale.

>I could go on and on. From charging residents for “terrorism insurance” for a fence to ripping out newly planted trees to charging residents for work that never happened, the absurdity of the fleecehold scam is apparent to everyone who has encountered it. However, there are  a number of ways in which we could solve the problem—and while we need to solve it for existing residents, which will involve some sort of right to manage and a much clearer ability to gain control of one’s own estate, we also need to prevent this model from being used in the future. We could take up the brilliant proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for North East Bedfordshire to prevent management companies from taking on services that are normally provided by local councils. We could also take up the suggestion made by Councillor Shaun Gunner, the leader of the Conservative group on Arun District Council, to change the Government’s guidance on the use of planning conditions, which currently states:

>I welcome my right hon. Friend to his place, and I welcome his comments on the unfairness of illegal immigration for those who have come here legally. However, the Supreme Court’s verdict this morning is extreme comprehensive, and it reveals not just one obstacle, but multiple obstacles to deporting people from this country. If we want to deter the small boats, we need to be able to remove significant numbers of people extremely quickly. Given the comprehensive nature of the judgment this morning, can I encourage my right hon. Friend against an incremental approach? It is clear from the ruling that we need to do something stronger now. We chose in the Illegal Migration Act not to include “notwithstanding” provisions, but I think we do need them now.

>My constituency has lots of these new estates. Often, the first people know of the problem is when they receive a massive bill that they did not know was coming and that was not mentioned in the notes they were given when they bought the house. And, funnily enough, it was not drawn to their attention by the lawyers of the housebuilder, whose services they are often encouraged to use. Some of these bills are a really scary size and often escalate quickly over time. A huge number of people—more and more every day—are now affected. About 20,000 estates are affected, involving between 1 million and 1.5 million homeowners and potentially 3 million or 4 million people. According to the Competition and Markets Authority, over the past five years 80% of the freehold properties built by the 11 biggest builders have used this fleecehold model.

>Residents of Hursley Park in my constituency have had no end of problems with their developer, who is currently refusing even to meet them to discuss some of their problems. Paths have been done on the cheap and have become a quagmire, and benches have not been looked after properly. Fortunately, owing to a legal error on the developer’s part, the residents have managed to gain control of the residents management committee, but after three years of effort they are still trying to get the developer to make good the problems so that they do not face years of bills. They are still fighting. Many of them do not want to run their own estate, and they should not have had to do so.

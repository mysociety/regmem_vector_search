>When I was growing up, my parents, who are in the Gallery today, offered up their home as foster parents. That experience has left me with a deep **interest** in the care system and how we enable care-experienced young people to have the future they deserve. While there are those in this place with far more experience in the field than me, my **interest** spans over two decades, and I am determined to be a voice for those young people.

>When I was growing up, my parents, who are in the Gallery today, offered up their home as foster parents. That experience has left me with a deep interest in the care system and how we enable care-experienced young people to have the future they deserve. While there are those in this place with far more experience in the field than me, my interest spans over two decades, and I am determined to be a voice for those young people.

>It is a pleasure to follow the maiden speech of the hon. Member for Dunfermline and Dollar (Graeme Downie). I was especially interested in his recollections of the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, which is also one of my early political memories, although I am obviously on the other side of the House as a result. I was interested in his reference to Monte Cassino, which might make sense later on in my speech.

>Life has dealt me experiences that have turned into passions that I am determined to build on here in Parliament. I have spent the last six years working for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission—hence the comment on Monte Cassino. From travelling around the south-west, sharing the stories of the men and women of the Commonwealth, whom the commission commemorates across the world, I have developed a lifelong passion for this wonderful organisation and the importance of keeping alive the stories of those who fell. I know that all hon. Members have recently heard from the commission about those commemorated in their constituencies, and I encourage them to get in touch with their regional public engagement co-ordinator if they would like to know more.

>South West Devon has to be one of the most unique constituencies in the country. I challenge hon. Members to name another constituency anywhere with our combination of urban and rural moorland and coastal communities. It combines the city suburbs of Plymouth—the ancient stannary town of Plympton, and Plymstock, with its rich maritime history—with the rural South Hams and Dartmoor national park. We have the thriving town of Ivybridge, the inland and coastal villages and farms of the South Hams, the historic country estates of Flete and Maristow, the villages on the edge of the Tamar valley, and rugged Dartmoor farms and villages. South West Devon is home to the new town of Sherford, the soon-to-expand community of Woolwell and Royal Marines 42 Commando at Bickleigh barracks. There is so much history, so much beauty and so many wonderful and unique communities—indeed, too many to list here and be finished by the Adjournment, hon. Members will be pleased to hear.

>Nearly 22,000 of my constituents will lose their winter fuel payments. Currently, only 1,500 will receive it. That is a massive cliff edge for those 22,000 residents. While many of them may feel that they do not require that payment, as has been mentioned by other hon. Members, the vast majority of those pensioners fall into low and middle-income brackets because things do not have such high financial value in the south-west.

>I would waste the opportunity to extol the virtues of South West Devon further if I left things there. Yes, transport is a big issue locally, whether that is about the need for a bus route between Plymstock and Plympton, cycle paths in the South Hams that do not require mountaineering experience to navigate, or improved junctions on and off the A38 at Lee Mill, but I hope I will be allowed just a few moments to introduce hon. Members more fully to South West Devon.

>A builder living on Portland, a B&B owner in Weymouth and a shopkeeper on Swanage high street all pay their fair share of tax, yet some individuals take advantage of offshore tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying their fair share. My constituents play by the rules; we ought to know a bit more about those who choose not to. Can the Secretary of State set out what steps his Department is taking to throw open the books in British tax havens and implement public registers of beneficial ownership?

>I welcome the Home Officeâ€™s decision to close the Bibby Stockholm barge in my constituency. We all know that barge is a gimmick. First, it arrived late; secondly, it cost the taxpayer a fortune; third, it was laden with fire and disease risks; and fourthly, it likely contributed to the death of a 27-year-old asylum seeker on board. Will the Prime Minister reassure my constituents that this and similar unworkable gimmicks will be closed down as we clear up the Conservative party mess?

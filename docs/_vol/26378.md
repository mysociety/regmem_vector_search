>Sir David Crausby had a long-standing **interest** in improving the railways in our regionâ€”something I hope to continue work on, having experienced cancellations on day one of travelling down to this place. Sir David  has been a great mentor of mine, and I hope to build on his legacy and do the people of Bolton North East proud. I wish him, his wife Enid and their family well, and I cannot thank them enough for their ongoing support.

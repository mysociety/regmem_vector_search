>I am grateful for the chance to participate. Tony was a calm and decent man and a gentleman. When I was elected in 1997, I was one of two Conservative MPs in Greater Manchester—and in 2001 I was one of one—but, right from the start, Tony was one of those who helped to set the tone for the way in which, regardless of party, we all worked together in the **interest**s of the city and the region. I always valued that enormously. That is an example to all Members of how we serve the wider public and not just our parties or our own **interest**s.

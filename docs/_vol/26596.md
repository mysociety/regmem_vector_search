>I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. Pension credit uptake is clearly critically important. From discussions I have had in my constituency, I know there are some myths around pension credit eligibility. Will the Secretary of State please confirm the efforts she is making on pension credit uptake, and does she agree with me that it is vital we ensure everyone who is eligible for pension credit receives it?

>My career as a solicitor has offered me a rich and varied experience for which I am very grateful. I specialised in competition law and spent time in the City, at the regulator and at Which?, which gave me particular insight into how markets and regulation work— and can work better—for consumers, businesses and the country as a whole. Given the serious ongoing pressures on living standards and family budgets in my constituency, and the challenges in our wider economy, the Government’s focus on those issues is extremely welcome. The Bill is so vital precisely because it will guard against the recklessness that unfortunately caused so many of my Northampton North constituents so much financial pain and additional hardship.

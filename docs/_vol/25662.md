>My right hon. Friend will know of the important role of the Carlton Club community **interest** company in Whalley Range in my constituency, as well as across Manchester. It is not just a social club but an important venue that supports grassroots music and arts. The company that owns the building has now threatened to end the CICâ€™s use of the site. Will the Leader of the House join me in calling for the building owners to reconsider their decision, and will she provide Government time to debate the importance of social clubs and small venues such as the Carlton Club to our local communities?

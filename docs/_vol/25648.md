>I welcome the Government’s commitment in the women’s health strategy to ensuring that employers are well equipped to support women during the menopause, but  the Government have shown little **interest** in trialling menopause leave in England, despite the evidence presented by the Women and Equalities Committee that it would make considerable savings.

>In the town of Dudley, the Conservative-led council has proposed the introduction of parking charges. That will affect students from Dudley College of Technology, learning development, local businesses, traders, users of the leisure centre and my residents, who will struggle with the costs. Will the Leader of the House allow a debate in Government time on how we support town centres and properly consider the potential negative impact on economic activity and community wellbeing caused by the hiking of parking charges?

>This Bill will also help us meet the challenges of the future. It will protect market stability and public trust, and ensure the Governmentâ€™s fiscal plans are independently and transparently scrutinised, future-proofing our economy. That will help business owners like my father, Ashok Kumar, who arrived in this country at the age of nine. He set up his own business and is still working as a greengrocer 45 years on. He taught me the importance of hard work and heritage. As a new MP, nothing gives me more pleasure than talking to business owners like my dad.

>Hon. Members will be pleased to know this speech is nowhere near the length of a Bollywood movie, and is coming to a close. I finish by turning once more to the people of Dudley. It is an honour to represent them and our great town in this House. I promise I will work as hard as I can to bring prosperity and happiness to our town, and I will not let them down.

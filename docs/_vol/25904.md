>The hon. Gentleman is making an **interest**ing point, and I want to ask him to explore it a little more. The immediate availability of redundancy  payments, if I can call it that, would not be affected by the motion, so is he suggesting that the motion is not fit for purpose either?

>I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for giving way. Is not the fact we are getting **interest**ing ideas coming from Labour Members an example of how the motion before the House is so ill thought out? Those ideas are not in the motion. Does she not agree that this is not the way to create legislation?

>As an aside, Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the great pleasures of these Friday sittings is that the research we have to do in order to make speeches gives us quite a lot of insight into legislation. I now know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you do not commit an offence if you drive off the road, but only if you do so within 15 yards of the carriageway and for the purpose of parking. It is also **interest**ing that in 1988, the unit of measurement used in legislation was yards, not metres, yet we decimalised in 1971. That was a slight tangent, but it was something that just sprung to mind.

>This motion is half-baked. We have seen over the course of a couple of hours a number of **interest**ing suggestions that could apply to potential legislation in this event. It is clearly an improper use of the disapplication of Standing Order No. 14. Look at the Labour Benches: if it such an emergency, why are those Benches so bare? Even Labour Members of Parliament do not think that this is urgent. I have no hesitation in voting against this motion and I invite everyone else to do the same.

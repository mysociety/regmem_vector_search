>Today’s statement by the Health Secretary will have been listened to with great **interest** by my constituents in Edinburgh West, who share a lot of the same concerns, face the same difficulty getting NHS dental treatment and will be looking for the same sort of solution as constituents in England. Could the Secretary of State clarify for me, and for all those who come to me, whether there will be Barnett consequentials? If there are, will she impress upon the Scottish Government the need to ringfence  the money and actually invest it in dental services? If not, would she be willing to share with the Scottish Government how she is approaching the problem in the hope that they might actually respond and do something?

>The hon. Member is making a very powerful speech, among many powerful and important speeches, about a sport that we all love. We have talked a lot about professional and elite football, but when it comes to the young— I **declare** an **interest**, as my nephew plays junior football—there is not the same financial reward, but the same danger is involved in heading a football.

>I rise to present a petition on the recommendations of the infected blood inquiry on behalf of the residents of my constituency of Edinburgh West. I have a long-standing **interest** in this as a friend of my family, who was one of the early victims of the infected blood scandal, has suffered as a consequence, along with many families including those in my constituency, waiting too long for redress.

>Does the hon. Member agree that, notwithstanding the fact that the fiscal framework has brought the two Governments to the table, the problems we are seeing with spending  and the constant arguments are not in the best **interest**s of the people of Scotland? What they really need is two Governments who work more closely together and in concert for Scotland.

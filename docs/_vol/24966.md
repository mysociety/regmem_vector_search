We are No. 7 on the template for new builds, so I would like to invite the Under-Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie) to come to Heysham to see for himself the good work of EDF and the new nuclear power programme that is coming to my constituency.

>The volunteers I spoke to were astonished that the “Eden MP”, as I was flatteringly called, has been deeply **interest**ed in their cause. They were also amazed that I had already secured a debate in the House of Commons on canal funding in the week of the King’s Speech.  I told them it will focus on the Northern Reaches, and I touched on my idea of water security distribution for the population via the canal system.

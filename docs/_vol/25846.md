>In fact, following a question about the VDPS earlier this year, the Prime Minister vowed to improve the scheme, so I will be **interest**ed to hear from the Minister about the Governmentâ€™s response to tackling those delays. Will the Minister confirm that the Government believe that the scheme is fit for purpose and whether they plan to update it? Will the Government assure us that the NHS Business Services Authority has the capacity to process applications to the VDPS in a timely manner? I urge Ministers to meet and engage with affected individuals and their families to look at ways to improve diagnosis and treatment and at how claims under the VDPS can be addressed more quickly.

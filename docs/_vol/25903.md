## 2023-09-06: Match score 60%

>Two weeks ago the Government announced that the Bolsover Schoolâ€™s bid for a sixth form in my constituency has been successful. Across the country, some 52% of school leavers at 16 years old go on to a sixth form, but in Bolsover it  is 23%, in Clowne it is 22%, and in Shirebrook it  is 7%. Will the Prime Minister join me in thanking the Redhill Academy Trust, Matthew Hall, the headteacher of Bolsover School, and all those who have helped to bring a sixth form to Bolsover?

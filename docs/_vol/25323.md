>As the hon. Gentleman will know, shortly before taking office the Foreign Secretary not only had all his **interest**s properly reviewed by the propriety and ethics team in my Department, but went through them with the independent adviser on ministers’ **interest**s. The independent adviser set out all relevant **interest**s, and those have been published, so the information is transparently out there for people to be able to judge for themselves.

>The Labour party keep on pushing on this point, but I refer the hon. Gentleman to the latest list of ministerial **interest**s, which was published in December and provides details of Minister’s **interest**s, including those of the Foreign Secretary, that are judged by the independent adviser to be relevant, or could be perceived to be relevant, to their ministerial roles. All of it is there in the public domain.

>First, the right hon. Gentleman talked about the range of risks that we face as a nation. He is absolutely right that one of the principal tasks of the Government and, indeed, my Department is to be across all of those risks, which we have done for many years through things such as the national security risk **register**. However, what we have done differently since covid is to be much more public about those risks through the national risk **register**, which sets out the range of risks that the nation faces, their likelihood and their impact. We have put an unprecedented amount of information into the public domain to help people prepare, whether as individuals or in businesses, local government or voluntary organisations.

>I would be very happy to do so. As my right hon. Friend points out, cyber-insurance plays a vital role in helping to build resilience and we have a shared **interest** in developing it. The National Cyber Security Centre has stood up the cyber-insurance industry working group, which is working through all these issues. I have met with Lloyd’s of London, and both I and Treasury Ministers will be happy to have further such meetings.

>The right hon. Gentleman raises a legitimate point about genomics and its relevance to critical national infrastructure. It is not currently designated as such, but in my role in the Cabinet Office, I keep the **register** of critical national infrastructure under review, and I am exploring the matter.

>There is an established regime under which Ministers’ **interest**s are **declare**d and managed. Ministers seek the advice of their permanent secretaries and the independent adviser on Ministers’ **interest**s, who reports twice yearly. This is but one element of a network of ethics systems, including the ministerial code and the business appointment rules, which uphold the highest standards in Government.

>I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman, as he knows, but I simply do not accept this slightly over-the-top characterisation of the Government’s approach. We have been consistent. First, we must protect our national **interest**s in relation to China. That is why we passed the legislation that I have outlined, why I banned Huawei from our 5G networks and why we banned Chinese technology from surveillance equipment and other matters.

>On the right hon. Gentleman’s point about the public record of the Electoral Commission, I think that that is the essence of what has happened here. These attacks and these attempts were ultimately pretty unsuccessful. I reassure the right hon. Gentleman and Members of this House that there was no infiltration of the closed **register** of the Electoral Commission, so the concerns that he raised have not arisen. On the further strengthening of the electoral **register**, that is precisely the work that the National Cyber Security Centre does in co-ordination with GCHQ, working with Government agencies, including the Electoral Commission.

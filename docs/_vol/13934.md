>I will support the Bill on Second Reading, but there is huge room for improvement. In particular, trading standards should be given the tools it needs to break the hold that illegal products already have on the market, and while we still have smokers, heated tobacco products should be removed from the generational ban as part of a broad range of less harmful alternatives. I must say that all those ethnic minority shopkeepers are concerned but supportive of this move; they believe that the ban should be in place, but that they should be supported. They feel strongly that at present, not enough support is  coming from the Bill and the Government. I hope that the Government will take on board some of what I have said, and that the Bill will emerge much amended on Third Reading.

>I rise to present a petition for Southall Crown post office on behalf of the residents of Ealing, Southall. Southall Crown post office is being closed against the will of local residents. This afternoon, along with my constituents, I delivered the Communication Workers Union and Ealing Labour petition to Post Office Ltdâ€™s chief executive officer, Nick Read. He refused to meet us. As they provide a vital public service, we urge the House of Commons to protect this and other offices of the Crown post office network, especially in the light of the maladministration of the Post Office exposed by the Horizon scandal.

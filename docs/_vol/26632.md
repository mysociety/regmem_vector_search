>I think I can justifiably claim to have a strong personal understanding of just how important it is to get your numbers exactly right, because, Madam Chair, if you ask me to think of a number, I do not need to ponder long. My lucky number is 15. Why? Because 15 is the size of my majority. I have the honour of holding the smallest majority in Parliament. It reminds me every day who sent me here, who I serve in this place, how grateful I am to the people who voted for me and how life turns on the very smallest of margins. So I pledge now to serve the people of Hendon, no matter how they voted, with every fibre of my being.

>I wish to start by thanking my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch (Katrina Murray) on her witty and passionate speech. Her commitment to public service and her drive to improve the lives of her constituents shine through. I would also like to compliment all those who have given their maiden speech today. The standard has been exceptional. What an honour it is to speak after so many inspiring colleagues, and what an honour it is to give my first speech in this Chamber during a debate on the future of our railways. So many of my constituents depend on Mill Hill Broadway and Hendon stations, and this Bill, bringing the railways back into public ownership, placing passengers at the heart of our rail system and ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, will make a real difference to them. Getting the management of our railways and the numbers underpinning them on a sound footing is crucial.

>I will never forget those who went before me as Members for Hendon. I want to pay tribute to Dr Matthew Offord, who represented Hendon for 14 years. I am grateful for his work on behalf of residents and for his advocacy, as chair of the APPG on explosive threats, for a landmine-free world. I thank Andrew Dismore, who was the personification of a dedicated constituency MP. Even today, 14 years after he left office, residents still talk of him. The impact he made was immense.

>When I think of our duty of service, I think of the woman who took my father from the ghetto and saved his life. I see her face every day in the people I seek to serve. I reflect on the small margins that make big differences and how what we say and how we act impacts on the lives of others. Whether it is uniting to tackle hate or building bridges across communities and across this House, I pledge to honour her example, reflect that spirit of service in everything I do, and work hard every day to serve the people of our country and the people of Hendon.

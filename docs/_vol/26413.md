>Thank you, Ms Cummins, for giving me the opportunity to speak. It is a real privilege to deliver my maiden speech in this debate on the Bill, which will see the biggest overhaul to transportation in a generation. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Grahame Morris) on making excellent points about placing passengers at the heart of decisions, rather than unthinkable profits for shareholders.

>I will also use my platform to strongly advocate for cohesion in society. I am driven by the belief that fairness and inclusion are core values that must be embodied in all that we do. I will do everything in my power to promote multiculturalism in our brilliant country and will reject the tired populism of blame, exclusion and hate. Our unity is our strength. Indeed, the positive reactions against the recent riots celebrated an identity of diversity and inclusiveness.

>I recognise that there are many priorities in politics, but building strong communities will always be at the heart of mine. I will champion localism, ensuring that local authorities and, equally, community organisations and charities get the support they need to deliver the best in early years, youth work and mental health support, creating local jobs and services for those who need them the most. I will press on the urgency of our commitment on climate action, where we work for the best interests of our planet rather than the interests of oil and gas companies. I will advocate for more affordable housing to provide younger people hope for the future.

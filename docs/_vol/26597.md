>I will use my experience in local government to ensure that legislation allows local authorities to invest to save, and to think much more long term—both things that I consider to be in the best **interest** of council tax payers. I will try to ensure that this Government’s approach to devolution is one that will genuinely pass power to local communities, which I think are best  placed to know what their areas need, and work in the best **interest** of my constituents. Finally, I hope to continue the cross-party working I have enjoyed with representatives from across Kent and the south-east, so that our region grows and prospers under this Government.

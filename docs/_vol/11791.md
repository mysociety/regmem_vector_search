>May I first warmly welcome the Solicitor General to her place, and the Attorney General to his place in the other place, in what the Solicitor General will already know is one of the most **interest**ing and challenging parts of government? While I am at it, I should of course also welcome the hon Member for Hammersmith and Chiswick (Andy Slaughter) as the new Chair of the Justice Committee

>It seems to me—I would be **interest**ed in my right hon. and learned Friend’s view—that on the basis of the Government’s proposed wording, it is more likely that a firm will be able to challenge whether the CMA has applied its proportionality test appropriately, but the means by which it will do so will be under JR principles on appeal, rather than on a merits basis. It is not that proportionality is not subject to challenge, but that that challenge is limited by JR principles at the appeal stage. Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree?

>Finally, I will say a few words about the amendments tabled by other right hon. and hon. Members. If you will forgive me, Madam Deputy Speaker, in the **interest**s of time, I will not speak to all the amendments proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr Fysh)—I can see that you approve. However, from what I have just said, he will gather that I cannot support his amendment (a) to Lords amendment 1, which would limit application of all the safety duties in the Bill to

>There is only one other matter that I want to touch on briefly, and it has been mentioned already: the grounds on which powers such as these can be used. There are, essentially, three. First, they can be used in the **interest**s of national security, and I have no argument with that. Secondly, they can be used in urgent cases to combat some forms of criminality. Thirdly, they can be used in the **interest**s of the economic wellbeing of the UK, in so far as those **interest**s are also relevant to national security. As the House knows, the last of those has long been controversial as an appropriate ground for action—and, of course, the more intrusive the powers that can be used with that justification, the more controversial it is. I think it fair to say that the ISC is concerned about its use in that regard, and I am sure the House will want to consider, as the Bill proceeds, whether its application to these powers and more generally is still appropriate.

>Throughout our consideration of the Bill, I have taken the view that we should be less **interest**ed in passing legislation that sounds good and more **interest**ed in passing legislation that works. We need the regulator to be able to encourage and enforce improvements in online safety effectively. That means asking the online platforms to address the harms that it is within their power to address, and to relate clearly the design or operation of the systems that they have put in place.

>Let me make it clear that I am not, of course, suggesting that what the Government have in mind here is in any way comparable to those two examples, but it seems that the point here is that to arrogate to oneself the right to **declare** one’s own compliance with international law runs the risk of, first, other states finding comfort in our example and, secondly, undermining our own messages in other situations

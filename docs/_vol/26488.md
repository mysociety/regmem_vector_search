>I welcome my right hon. Friend and his team to their place. He had the privilege of visiting Basingstoke college of technology during the election campaign to meet some of the fantastic apprentices and students there. Further to his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Andrew Pakes), will he commit to working with colleges such as BCOT as he develops the plan for skills and training for the hundreds of thousands of jobs we need to deliver on our ambition of a clean energy superpower?

>I welcome the Secretary of State’s answer. On doorsteps, in surgeries and over email, families across Basingstoke have told me countless stories of the obstacles they have to go through just to have the barest acknowledgement of their child’s needs, only to go through a similar obstacle course for their child to be assessed, and yet again for them to get the help they are legally entitled to. Can the Secretary of State offer families in Basingstoke with experience of this failing system some hope that they can expect better in future?

>I welcome the Minister and the entire ministerial team to their places. Public sector fraud underwent a massive spike during the pandemic, as  personal relationships trumped proper due diligence. With billions of pounds still in the hands of fraudsters, it is imperative that the new Government work quickly to recover what was lost. I therefore also welcome the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s new covid fraud commissioner. What steps will the Government and her Department take to ensure that the money is recovered as quickly as possible, and indeed that something like this never happens again?

>Many of my constituents, including those at Chapel Gate, have told me about the so-called management agents, who charge them rip-off service fees and then fail to provide even the most basic of maintenance. Many constituents spend hours each week battling these agents, just to ensure that they and their neighbours are not fleeced in their own homes. Will the Prime Minister recommit this Government to acting—where the previous Government failed—to reform the leasehold system, which is archaic, outdated and feudal?

>On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Over the weekend, I saw on social media that a number of Labour Members had the good judgment to visit the beautiful Bishop Auckland constituency, and while I am grateful to the one Member who gave me notice of their visit, that was in stark contrast to the four Members—the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner), and the hon. Members for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson), for Blaydon (Liz Twist), and for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)—who did not have the good judgment to follow your advice, Mr Speaker, and notify me as the sitting MP. I have let them know of my intention to raise this issue in the Chamber today. Could you advise the House once again on how we can ensure that Members give notice of a visit to another Member’s constituency?

>I know that this place can have a reputation for being home to nothing more than Punch and Judy politics, but in debates like these, we see the best of this House, as people raise their experiences and those of their constituents, and work, often in a cross-party fashion, to bring forward changes to legislation that will have the right sort of tangible impact for everyone across our country. On that basis, I will support a number of amendments, including those of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Elliot Colburn) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes), and, of course, the new clause that my right hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) and my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Dame Tracey Crouch) tabled in Committee, which I am glad the Government accepted.

>Once again, I am very grateful to all colleagues who signed new clause 9. I would of course have liked it to be accepted and to see it pass, but all of us in this place know that we cannot let the perfect get in the way of the good. If someone had told me at the start of this campaign that we would achieve what we have managed to achieve today, I would have bitten their arm off. I was recently asked whether I consider this package of measures to be my legacy; I absolutely do not, mainly because I am not going to stop campaigning on this issue even when I have left this place. It is the legacy of all those families who have lost loved ones, of all those campaigners who have fought for change and, of course, of my dad Dominic. I know that he would be as grateful as I am to the Government for the positive steps that they have brought forward today.

>So many colleagues have said this, but my biggest thanks have to go to my constituents, the brilliant people of the Bishop Auckland constituency, who put their faith in me. I was a young woman who was not even from the county, but they put their faith in me as a Conservative; this was the first time they had elected a Conservative Member of Parliament since the seat was created in 1885. I am so grateful to each and every one of the 24,067 people who put their cross in the box next to my name. I could tell so many tales, but I will not now. All I will say is that in meeting so many constituents over the years, I have had moving experiences and  incredibly supportive conversations. There has been a lot fun, as well as a lot of heated debates at points. I am particularly grateful to those constituents who may not have agreed with me or some of the decisions I have made, but who have handled all the communication and the debate well, and with respect.

>The new clause is based on legislation introduced in a number of Australian states. We have used very similar wording to try to make it as specific as possible. I am incredibly grateful for the engagement from the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, including from the Secretary of State for Justice, the Home Secretary and, of course, my hon. Friend the Minister. I appreciate  their concerns about creating discrepancies in the law—for example, our new clause talks specifically about a punch, so if someone were to be slapped forcefully and fall over backwards, the clause would not apply. Of course, I do not want to allow emotions to dominate when we are ultimately here in this House as legislators to make the best law and have the best possible impact for our constituents.

>I do not intend to press my new clause to a vote because the Government have—again, I am grateful for this—come forward with a wonderful package of measures that we believe will make a brilliant and tangible difference for the families impacted by such horrendous tragedies. For example, we have been offered a full review of low-culpability homicides, taking into account not just single punches but any single blow and other such crimes, to look at whether or not a sentencing review is needed. Of course, we would like that review to get started as quickly as possible, and I know that the Minister recognises the urgency with which we have been campaigning on this matter. I and One Punch UK look forward to working with her and the Victims’ Commissioner to get that review under way; I will be on their backs, making sure that it is a strong review with strong recommendations, and will be pushing for the Government to accept the recommendations at the end of the process.

The person I need to thank most of all is my absolutely brilliant, inspiring and dazzling partner Tony, who ensures that when I get home from a late-night vote, there is food on the table,  and who picks me up and really lights me up on my darkest days, and makes me want to be the best I can be.

I would not have been able to achieve anything in this place—and I mean anything—without my incredible team: Joanne Howey, Niki Trotter, James Middleton, and the two who are up in the Public Gallery, Jack Bell and Ellie Varley. I am an only child—I have never had siblings—but through doing this job and hiring those two incredible people up in the Gallery, I have gained a brother and sister. They are not getting rid of me just yet—or if they are, it is only as a boss, never as a sibling.

Only last week I was here in the Chamber making an emotional speech—one of the few emotional speeches I have made; I was tearing up a little—not expecting to have to make another for a while. I talked about the impact of my dad’s death through a single punch, how that has motivated me, and all the work that I have done and the incredible people I have met—those at One Punch UK, and other families campaigning to improve awareness and improve the outcome for victims. I secured some brilliant commitments from the Government, which is now a laugh, isn’t it, given that I will have to have to fight the next Government to make sure that they carry those over?

>This place is such an adventure. I do not just mean getting lost in my first few weeks here, when I would accidently find myself in the kitchens or on a rooftop where I was not supposed to be. I find being here as a young woman particularly funny, because mine is not the face of a traditional MP, as most people like to point out. I have been quizzed so many times on whether I am an intern or here on work experience. Now that I am 30, I find it incredibly brilliant to know that I still have a youthful face. Even today, on my final day in this place, I was quizzed by security when I was going out on the Terrace with my lunch. They asked, “Excuse me, madam, do you have a parliamentary pass?” It is wonderful that our security are doing their jobs so diligently. It is also nice to know that I have clearly made a substantial impact in my four and a half years here!

It is about coming in every morning and seeing colleagues, sometimes smiling and sometimes with grumpy faces, and knowing that we are one team—comrades—here to make this country the best it can be. There are too many memories to share, and I do not want to name too many individuals for fear of offending others, but I pay tribute to the man sitting right beside me, my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes North (Ben Everitt). I have fond memories of our first rebellion together—the first of not too many, colleagues will be pleased to know. We basically egged each other on, and admitted only once we were out of the voting Lobby, “I wasn’t going to do it if you weren’t!” To the Whips, I am sincerely sorry for that, but I have no regrets about sharing that special memory with one of my closest friends.
